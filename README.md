# A static site I built to practise my frontend skills

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap it

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### What I learned
useState, useEffect, useContext, useNavigate hooks
routing with React Router
