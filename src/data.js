      text: `Shortly after a dusky morning, on the 10th of June 2018, a message beeped somewhere in a city called Pasadena. A thousand other messages may have beeped around the same instance in the city located in the golden state of California, but this message was somewhat special. Not just special, but it also seems to carry high importance. There were dozens of brainiacs, each one of them wearing a blue t-shirt with some alphabetical logo on it, anticipating for this message to arrive. Maybe it was their daily job, and they were wearing their everyday uniform and receiving the day-to-day messages they used to receive but still, trust me, this message holds an absolute significance.


The message was not from a nearby city, or a nearby state, or a country. It was from a world, far-far away, So far that, if you are an average modern-day Homosapien and it takes you around 10-mins for a mile run, It would take you about just shy of six thousand years to reach there, well ruling out the fact that there were the paths which go that far, forsooth. To make it easy for you, it would take about 100 healthy lifetimes for a nomadic heart to walk past it without a means of transportation. But don't get your things to pack yet, cause, let me assure you, nobody has ever been there. It is a red-robust plain with an absolute charisma that can exhilarate the heart of any wanderer. Yet, not the mightiest of the men, accompanied with the grandest taste of adventure, ever even dared.


Okay, before your cortisol level elevates and you start cursing me for this Sherlock-Shakespeare crossover, I'm gonna disclose it. The message was from a rover named 'Opportunity' which landed on our neighboring red-planet on the 25th of Jan, 2004. You don't need to sneak peek at your calendar; The day was exactly 18 years ago.


In the summer of 2003, when I was presumably crying, laying somewhere in the corner of my bed as every other 3-month-old baby does, NASA was initiating one of the biggest planetary missions in its history. Two magnificent rovers named 'Spirit' and 'Opportunity' were being launched from the Boeing Delta-II rockets, managed by NASA's launch service program. Both of the rovers left Earth's atmosphere in the span of 3 weeks and set their three-hundred-million-mile journey. It took them around 6 months to set foot on Martian soil. On their exploration, not only did they display their engineering marvels and technical embodiments. They outperformed the assumptions and transcended the expectations in every practicable manner. They stand out to their names from every inclination; Spirit was landed in an extremely severe environment, very difficult for exploration due to its harsh surface, with an additional freezing winter on account of the high elevation. Still, it performed its job extra-ordinarily with high spirits. The Opportunity was pretty opportunistic in this case, the surface it had to explore was plain craters with a blooming chill. Overlooking the occasional dust-storms and festive martian breezes it had to experience, the rest of the journey it had taken must have been Oscar-worthy to look upon. Because 'Everywhere he went, He was the first.'


The journey of the twin brothers had been quite remarkable. Their expedition enabled us to have the literal Human outlook on the red planet. Alongside their lively adventure in Martian topography, they achieved quite remarkable feats, too. Determining the fact that they were landing on the opposite side of the planet, their mission was distinct. The Opportunity was landed at Meridiani Planum, a place where mineral deposits suggested that Mars had a wet history, whereas his elder twin was landed on Gusev Crater. As per NASA's report, these robotic explorers have trekked for miles across the Martian surface, conducting field geology and making atmospheric observations. Carrying identical, sophisticated sets of science instruments, both rovers have found evidence of ancient Martian environments where intermittently wet and habitable conditions existed. The twin rovers have sent hundreds of thousands of spectacular, high-resolution, full-color images of Martian terrain as well as detailed microscopic images of rocks and soil surfaces to Earth. Different spectrometers have accumulated unparalleled information about the chemical and mineralogy makeup of Martian geology. With data from the rovers, mission scientists have reconstructed an ancient past when Mars was awash in water. Spirit and Opportunity each found evidence for past wet conditions that possibly could have supported microbial life.


Doesn't matter how soothing it may sound, or how breath-taking the journey might unfold; there's an end to every story. So was, to our twin brothers, spirit held his heads high up and served science and humanity 20 times more than the period which was originally anticipated, and got retired by sending its last signal on 22nd of March, 2010. The younger one seems more daredevil. He was able to stay operational for 5,111 martian days after landing, maintaining its power and key systems through continual recharging of its batteries with the help of solar power, and hibernating during events such as dust storms to save energy. This enabled him to withstand its mission for 57 times than its designed lifespan. The NASA scientists who operated and devised this mission had by far anticipated 6 months to a few years of extension. But Opportunity with its Roby spirit broke the record for extraterrestrial travel by rolling greater than the distance of a 42-kilometer in 2015, and by far exceeding the initial plan by 14 years and 46 days. In early 2018, due to the planetary dust-storm on Mars, Opportunity ceased communications and entered hibernation. It was hoped that it would reboot once the weather cleared, but it did not, suggesting either a catastrophic failure or that a layer of dust had covered its solar panels. Shortly after a dusky morning, on the 10th of June 2018, a message beeped somewhere in a city called Pasadena. It was in NASA's jet propulsion laboratory planetary division's opportunity's mission control`,

      text: `Whether it’s being turned to a stone while gazing into Medusa’s eyes or having a Minotaur eat one’s liver, demons have always been terrifying since antiquity. Yet some of the most infamous demons are not remembered for their outrageous brutality, but for creating muddling perplexity. One such demon with a very tantalizing name was Maxwell’s demon, who ruled the boundless realm of statistical mechanics for decades. Although imaginary, the demon taught the higher fidelity, that even negated the gods. It served its whole life overseeing the trapdoor in Maxwell’s thought experiment. It wasn’t until recently that physicists partially defeated it using a real experimental evidence.


Contrary to Einstein’s assertion, the gods do love playing dice with the universe. As is the case in any thermodynamic system inside the universe. The randomness tends to increase, when the system undergoes any process. That randomness or disorder is more precisely what scientists refer to as entropy. Dropping a thimbleful of crimson dye into a swimming pool spreads those dye molecules throughout the water. This tendency as quantified by the second law of thermodynamics, takes on an almost mathematical certainty. But this certainty was nearly violated after James Clerk Maxwell, the greatest theoretical physicist of the 18th century, proposed a thought which drew an implication that entropy doesn’t necessarily increase.


Maxwell’s thought sounds relatively simple at first glance, but the complex mysteries it unwraps, are manifold. It imagines a system consisting of two insulated gas compartments X and Y with a little conducting trapdoor in-between. At the microscopic level, both gas compartments hold gazillions of tiny elastic molecules having different velocities which are bumping into each other, transferring energy and momentum. There are fast-moving agitated molecules (represented by color red) in each compartment as well as the slow-moving dull molecules (represented by color blue) whose velocities together sum up to give a definite average velocity. The average velocity is what defines the average kinetic energy and average kinetic energy in turn defines the temperature of the compartment. Thus, the compartment X in our case has a higher temperature than the compartment Y, since the molecules on X are jiggling and bouncing more rapidly in average than the molecules on Y.


After we know the microstates of the molecules, we could draw an energy distribution curve for both the gas samples. In layman’s terms, microstate plainly refers to the specific configuration or arrangement of constituent parts of a system. We define T1 and T2 as the average kinetic energy of all the molecules in X and Y compartments respectively. T1 and T2 are also the respective temperature of the compartments in the Kelvin scale such that T1>T2. If we analyze the graph for the warmer gas sample in the X compartment, there are a substantial number of molecules whose energy level is exactly T1, but also few stationary molecules that could be really close to absolute zero temperature. Also, we have a cluster of molecules in X that could have higher kinetic energy than the average kinetic energy T1. For the colder gas sample in Y compartment, most of the molecules have a low energy level T2 but there are a handful of molecules whose kinetic energy are even higher than T1. Limited number of molecules in Y could also be not moving at all. It’s just a hodgepodge of insights.

Provided that the gas compartments were conducting, they would have inexorably attained the thermal equilibrium, categorically a disordered state. But both the compartments are insulating as aforementioned and the trapdoor is flexible too. That’s when the mythical demon comes into play. Observing the molecules on both sides, it guards the trapdoor according to the need. When a faster-than-average molecule from Y compartment flies towards the trapdoor , the demon opens it, and the molecule will fly from Y to X. Likewise, when a slower-than-average molecule from X compartment flies towards the trapdoor, the demon will let it pass from X to Y. In doing so, the average velocity of the molecules in the X compartment will have increased further thus raising the temperature. While in the Y compartment, the molecules will have slowed down on average thus decreasing the temperature even more. In such a case, both the compartments would tend towards an orderly state contravening the concept of increasing entropy and defying the second law in general.


The thorny demon in this thought experiment startled the scientists for long and made them scratch their heads. It provoked an unsolvable conundrum in the scientific community which sounded metaphysical on some level. Some mortals even termed the experiment as very fuzzy. But the demon would have its last laugh when a more complete analysis was made of the whole system including the demon. The key while analyzing was to point out the features a real-life Maxwell’s demon would need to have. It would need some means of measuring molecular velocity, and that the act of acquiring molecular velocity would require a track of where all those microscopic molecules were. It would also require a probabilistic determination of the final position of all the molecules in a certain time resolution scrutinizing the trajectory too. The demon would have to bounce light off all the molecules or even use an electron microscope for pinpoint measurement. If the demon’s brain wasn’t super calculative, a hardcore computer microchip with intensive computation power would be needed that would churn away a lot of information. Operating the microchip and an electron microscope would generate a lot of heat energy, lowering the overall entropy too. The demon would also have to perform the data analysis of gazillions of traversing molecules, consequently extracting figures from almost every bit of data chunk. Consideration of all these facts makes the Maxwell’s demon quite impossible.


And even if it was possible, the demon, its devices and the gas would be interacting with each other. Therefore, we would have to consider the combined entropy of the gas, the demon and the devices. The expenditure of energy by the demon, its chip and the microscope would cause the overall system to be more disordered, stabilizing the lowered entropy of the gas.


But what if we wanted to assemble a demon like this, probably in our world today for ultimate verification? For that sake, we’d have to use some type of super computer with numerous sensors in it. Recently, physicists have attempted to do this, in the laboratory and the results aren’t in demon’s favor, as predicted. The computer and the whole system generated more entropy than the entropy that was lost, ensuring that the second law of thermodynamics was indeed authentic.


So, while it might not be easy to falsify the Maxwell’s demon mathematically with rigorous proofs, our current understanding of the paradox disregards it completely. We may not have defeated the Maxwell’s demon utterly in present, but there’s a silver lining for sure. More accurate lab experiments will follow, and more research findings will take over. The demonic laughter would then have to wait, to resonate through our eardrum and haunt our senses again.`,

      text: `As Mars possesses the large supplies of carbon and hydrogen needed to produce the pure silicon required for producing photovoltaic panels and other electronics, it is enormously advantageous to manufacture solar panels and create a self-expanding power base. And Mars has both in the short and medium term in the form of its geothermal power resources that offers potential for large numbers of locally created electricity generating stations in the 10 MegaWatt class. This may help a lot to create a vibrant civilization. 

Natural sunlight can't be used on the moon or any other airless body in space unless walls are put on the greenhouse thick enough to shield out solar flares. This comparatively increases the expense of creating cropland. A thin-walled inflatable plastic greenhouse protected by an unpressurized UV-resistant hard plastic shield can be used to quickly create cropland on the surface of Mars, as it already has a thick atmosphere to protect crops grown on the surface from solar flares. Such domes create a strong greenhouse effect necessary to produce a temperature climate inside. 

Domes up to 50 meters in diameter are light enough to get transported from Earth, and later on they can be manufactured and deployed, opening up large areas of the surface for both human habitation and agriculture. It will eventually make it possible for humans to thicken Mars' atmosphere through a deliberate program of artificially induced global warming. Once the habitation domes become virtually of any size, as they wouldn't have to sustain a pressure difference between interior and exterior, it will be possible to raise specially bred crops outside the domes. Therefore, unlike colonists on any other extraterrestrial known body, Martian colonists will be able to live on the surface, but not in tunnels and eventually they will be able to move about freely and grow crops in the daylight. 

Even in the absence of native life forms, there is an obligation for the colonists to attempt to preserve where possible the unspoiled alien environment, to ensure our sustained survival on the Red Planet. Yet, it is unclear how these ideas of preservation of native environment would balance those of terraforming Mars through global engineering to make its surface and climate hospitable to humans. If attainable, the latter would make colonization of Mars safer and more sustainable. Clearly, it would not be possible to transport all the raw materials required for sustained growth and operation of a colony from Earth.`,

A thin-walled inflatable plastic greenhouse protected by an unpressurized UV-resistant hard plastic shield can be used to quickly create cropland on the surface of Mars, as it already has a thick atmosphere to protect crops grown on the surface from solar flares. Such domes create a strong greenhouse effect necessary to produce a temperature climate inside. 

Domes up to 50 meters in diameter are light enough to get transported from Earth, and later on they can be manufactured and deployed, opening up large areas of the surface for both human habitation and agriculture. It will eventually make it possible for humans to thicken Mars' atmosphere through a deliberate program of artificially induced global warming. Once the habitation domes become virtually of any size, as they wouldn't have to sustain a pressure difference between interior and exterior, it will be possible to raise specially bred crops outside the domes. Therefore, unlike colonists on any other extraterrestrial known body, Martian colonists will be able to live on the surface, but not in tunnels and eventually they will be able to move about freely and grow crops in the daylight. 

Even in the absence of native life forms, there is an obligation for the colonists to attempt to preserve where possible the unspoiled alien environment, to ensure our sustained survival on the Red Planet. Yet, it is unclear how these ideas of preservation of native environment would balance those of terraforming Mars through global engineering to make its surface and climate hospitable to humans. If attainable, the latter would make colonization of Mars safer and more sustainable. Clearly, it would not be possible to transport all the raw materials required for sustained growth and operation of a colony from Earth.`,

      text: `This project aims to create software that enables users to get a practical approach to charge and fields of particles that can’t be done in a common laboratory. We tried to keep the user interface as simple as possible. The program also includes 5 different modes in each design and each mode has a different application, data visualization, calculations, and interpretations. Users can get useful mathematical results as per the input and also learn the concepts from the remarks button. In a nutshell, it is an elegant and appropriate alternative to experiments of charge in a precise but easy way.

The approach for this project was the division of a Physics team and a Data team. The Physics team prepared modules for the concepts required and to be simulated ideas and submitted them to the Data team while the Data team did the coding and prepared user-friendly effects in the software. We’ve used Javascript for the program. We didn’t receive any venture capital for this project so, there are no business drivers. However, we intend to get this program to high schools at a very nominal cost. We expect this program to be profusely effective and useful for students to experiment with things that are not applicable in school labs and understand the topic.

      text: `Low-Cost High Altitude Balloon is a proffer project that helps the space empiricist send the experiment to a near-space environment with moderate outlay. Basically for the science experiment, we tend to use rockets for sending the experiment which is costly so to reduce the cost of the experiment, we have used high altitude balloons to send the experiment to the near-space environment. This environment is the same as the environment of the mars so we can conduct numerous experiments at a low cost. We have built a course and a list of materials for the low-cost high-altitude balloon. We have used the parachute method for the deployment of the balloon and a Geo-fencing based flight termination for burst.
